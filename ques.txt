1.*Absolute Path:-
***A path is either relative or absolute. An absolute path always contains the root element and the complete directory list required to locate the file.
 For example, /home/sally/statusReport is an absolute path. All of the information needed to locate the file is contained in the path string.
***Absolute path is the full directory such as C:\XyzWs\test.txt. 
 
 **Relative Path:-
 Relative path is relative to the directory you are in, so if you are in the above directory, 
 then if you reference file test.txt as relative, it assumes the same directory you are in.
 When you do ../ then it goes back one directory.
 
 A relative path needs to be combined with another path in order to access a file. For example, joe/foo is a relative path. 
 Without more information, a program cannot reliably locate the joe/foo directory in the file system.
 
 
 2.CSS Introduction - 

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,
 or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
 
 
 CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
 It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types
 of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
 
 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
 
 3.How can we bold a text using CSS?
 <strong>bold</strong>
 
4.]How can we change the format and color of text using CSS?
 *** <p style="font-family:Courier; color:Blue; font-size: 20px;">This text has the font Courier, is Blue, and 20px.</p>
  
  ***p.normal {
    font-style: normal;
    
}

p.italic {
    font-style: italic;
}

p.oblique {
    font-style: oblique;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="normal">This is a paragraph, normal.</p>
<p class="italic">This is a paragraph, italic.</p>
<p class="oblique">This is a paragraph, oblique.</p>

*Translates program one statement at a time.         *	Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
 
 6.The Lifetime of JavaScript Variables:-
The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared.

Local variables are deleted when the function is completed.

Global variables are deleted when you close the page.

7.Unit testing is the testing of single entity (class or method).
 Unit testing is very essential to every software company to give a quality product to their customers.
 
 JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development,
 and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit, that originated with JUnit.

 
 8. How many tags you have used in CSS?
 <a>,<h> etc
 
 
 
9. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is an interpreted programming or script language from Netscape
JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. JavaScript is easy to learn.
an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers



10. What is scope in javascript?
Scope refers to where variables and functions are accessible, and in what context it is being executed. 
Basically, a variable or function can be defined in a global or local scope.
 Variables have so-called function scope, and functions have the same scope as variables.

 
 
 11. How many types of scope are there in JavaScript?
 (a)Local JavaScript Variables
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.

Local variables have local scope: They can only be accessed within the function.

Example
// code here can not use carName

function myFunction() {
    var carName = "Volvo";

    // code here can use carName

}
(2)Global JavaScript Variables
A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. 

Example
var carName = " Volvo";

// code here can use carName

function myFunction() {

    // code here can use carName 

}
(3)Automatically Global
If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.

This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function.

Example
myFunction();

// code here can use carName 

function myFunction() {
    carName = "Volvo";
}

12. What is rootscope?
*$rootScope refers to an object which is accessible from everywhere of the application. 
*$rootScope is a parent scope of all $scope and can be shared to all $scope. One application can have only one $rootScope.
You can think $rootScope as global variable and $scope as local variables.



13. How we can find the length of an array?
**string_name.length()
**String car [];
System.out.println(car.length);
**You need to initialize it first, and then you can use .length:

String car[] = new String[] { "BMW", "Bentley" };
System.out.println(car.length);



14. How a specific position array can be fetched from array? int n[4]={12,3,2,34};printf("Element[%d] = %d\n",n[2] );
   
15. "5"+2+7 what will be the output?
527
16. 2+"8" what will be the output?
28
17. What is the length of a String,char, int?


18. Tell me about your project?


19. What is angularjs?
Angular JS is an open source JavaScript framework that is used to build web applications. It can be freely used, changed and shared by anyone.
Angular Js is developed by Google.
It is an excellent framework for building single phase applications and line of business applications.

Advantage of AngularJS

There are a lot of JavaScript frameworks for building web applications. So, it is a genuine question, why to use Angular JS.

Following are the advantages of AngularJS over other JavaScript frameworks:
*Great for SPA (Single-Page Applications)
*Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection specifies a design pattern in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard coding them within 
the component.
*Two way data binding: AngularJS creates a two way data-binding between the select element and the orderProp model. orderProp is then used as the input for
 the orderBy filter.
*Testing: Angular JS is designed in a way that we can test right from the start. So, it is very easy to test any of its components through unit testing and
 end-to-end testing.
*Model View Controller: In Angular JS, it is very easy to develop application in a clean MVC way. You just have to split your application code into MVC 
components i.e. Model, View and the Controller.
*Directives, filters, modules, routes etc.


20. What is JQuery?
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document
traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much 
simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.


21. What is better AngularJS or JQuery explain with example?
JQuery is best suited for DOM manipulation while AngularJS is suited for web application development.
 So when you are looking to develop robust applications, then opt for AngularJS and in order to
 add more functionality and to perform DOM manipulation on the website, then stick with jQuery.
